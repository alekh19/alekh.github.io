Given two arrays of integers and asked to determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered.
The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array.
These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. Determine how many such numbers exist.
input format:
a: an array of integers
b: an array of integers
output format:
Print the number of integers that are considered to be between a and b.
code:
count=0
count2=0
i=max(a)
j=i
while True:
    if i>min(b): # if i is greater than smallest element of b recursion terminates.
        break
    res=all(i%k==0 for k in a) # checking if elements of a are all factors of i.
    if res==False:
        i=i+1
        j=i
    else:
        count2=count2+1
        i=j*count2
        res2=all(k%i==0 for k in b) # checking if the integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the b.
        if res2==True:
            count=count+1
    return count
